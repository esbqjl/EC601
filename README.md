The API Exercise is using the twitter API as a searching API.
It will browser and download the tweets from the users in Twitter who sent the keywords which we are searching in recent 7 days.
The basic result will be sorted in a datafile. For the fundamental version, it only extracts the user_info from searching contents.
The furthermore will be detect whether they are bot or not, unfortunately, botmeters has been down for a while, I'm looking for a avaliable APO to replace that.
